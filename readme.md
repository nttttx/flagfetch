# flagfetch

Flagfetch is a **dynamic** fetch utility that is trying to be compact and ship with zero dependencies (except Python).

## Example output
```
Linux
 + Fedora Linux 40 (Toolbx Container Image) | SystemD | EFI | Merged usr
```

## Customizing
I made the source code quite readable, so anybody can modify it to get what they need.
